That’s what makes these new abstract artworks by Jennie C. Jones so mind-bending. Three massive instrument sculptures now sit on the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s rooftop in Jones’ latest work titled “Ensemble.” But only one of the instruments makes sound when it’s activated by the wind. The other two don’t make sound at all, even though they’re capable of doing so. That's exactly the point. Instead, their potential for sound and the tension between dormancy and activation is where they hold power. Go see these cool sculptures on the Met’s gorgeous rooftop through October 19.\n"

He is a man with a tale to tell of how he got there: but, like Dewey Cox inWalk Hard, he has to start at the very beginning: with a childhood of a bad daddy (Charles Dance) and grief that drives an ambition to conquer death itself. Isaac is superb as Victor, as much an artist as a scientist; his gruesome work accompanied by Alexander Desplat's joyful waltz as he peels skin and gets elbow deep in viscera. Del Toro makes no secret of where his sympathy lies and who the real monsters are, but there are surprises here. Not least of which is how moved you might feel in the end. It's in theaters as of this weekend.\n",

Not only is he not a mastermind, Josh O’Connor’s unemployed Massachusetts carpenter James Blaine ‘JB’ Mooney would makeFargo’s Jerry Lundegaard look like the last word in criminal competence. Mooney plans to steal four abstract – and fairly low value – portraits by modernist painter Arthur Dove from his local gallery based loosely on a real-life 1973 heist of Massachusetts’s Worcester Art Museum, With the vinyl feel of ’70s cinema and powered by Rob Mazurek’s jazzy heist movie score,The Masterminda wonderfully evocative of a very specific moment in pre-Watergate America: a time of campus protests, fugitives from the draft, and political awakening. Nicely played with an on-form O’Connor, the frowning, sweater-clad Mooney is a counterpoint to all of that. He’s only a runaway from his own life. See it in theaters as of October 17.\n"

That wait, though, turns out to be a very smart move. Four years have also passed inBlack Phone 2’s reality. That time has not healed Finn and his sister Gwen (again played by Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw). In the original, 13-year-old Finn was kidnapped by serial child-killer ‘The Grabber’ (Ethan Hawke) and kept in a basement, awaiting execution. Finn bested the killer with the help of past victims, who contacted him by phone from beyond the grave, and his sister’s peculiar premonitions. There’s still plenty here to make you shiver, but in letting events out of the basement this sequel has also released much of the tension. It's in theaters on October 17.\n"

            "27.\"Divine Egypt\" at The Met The Met's first major exhibition of Egyptian art in over a decade ison its way.From October 21 until January 19, 2026, \"Divine Egypt\" will focus in on images of gods in ancient Egypt. The exhibit considers how these physical tools brought the gods to life for daily worship, offering ancient Egyptians a vital connection between the human and divine worlds. Spanning more than 3,000 years, the Egyptian people's belief system grew to include more than 1,500 gods with many overlapping forms and traits. At the exhibit, expect to see statues and small elegant figurines that represent 25 of ancient Egypt's main deities. Look for subtle visual cues, like what a figure wore, how they posed or the symbols they carried to help identify each one. \"The ways in which the ancient Egyptian gods were depicted are vastly different from the divine beings in contemporary religions and therefore are intriguing to modern audiences,\" said Diana Craig Patch, Lila Acheson Wallace Curator in Charge of Egyptian Art in a press release about the exhibition. \"The identity of an ancient Egyptian god may at first seem easy to recognize but looks can be deceiving, as one form can be shared by many deities. Across more than 3,000 years of history, gods, attributes, roles and myths were rarely dropped from use, yet the Egyptians of the time had no difficulty understanding and accepting the resulting multiplicity. Through hundreds of spectacular objects, 'Divine Egypt' will allow visitors to understand the complex nature of these deities and help translate the images that were needed to make the inhabitants of the celestial realm available to ancient Egyptians.\" The exhibition will conclude with artifacts relating to the transition to the next life.\n"

But through February 22, 2026, Poster House is bringing the parks to us in \"Blazing A Trail: Dorothy Waugh’s National Parks Posters.\" It's the first exhibition dedicated to Waugh's parks campaign. \"Blazing A Trail\" features 17 travel posters designed between 1934 and 1936 by landscape architect and highly trained artist Dorothy Waugh, created for the National Park Service’s first ever poster campaign. Before Waugh came along, it was actually America’s railroad companies who were the main source of advertising for the National Parks Service in the 1870s. Their posters were, yes, attractive, but very conventional. Waugh was the first to advocate for the bureau to produce its own poster campaign, along with styling and messaging, separate from the railroads. Waugh continued this work for the rest of the 20th century, leaving a legacy that endures today.\n"

            "33.\"Witnessing Humanity: The Art of John Wilson\" at the Met For over 60 years, American artist John Wilson created powerful and poetic works that reflected his life as a Black American artist and his ongoing quest for racial, social and economic justice. Until February 8, 2026, The Met on Fifth Avenue will host his first-ever solo museum show with more than 100 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures and illustrated books. To start, the exhibition showcases work Wilson made while at art school in Boston, where his subjects included the horrors of Nazi Germany and American racial violence, as well as portraits of his family and neighborhood. Wilson happened to be a traveler, and work from his time in Paris, Mexico City and New York will also be on view. Finally, the exhibition concludes with Wilson’s return to Boston and his focus on portraiture. Wilson's sculpture of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the United States Capitol and the monumental sculptureEternal Presence, two of his most celebrated works, will be on display.\n"

            "37.\"Man Ray: When Objects Dream\" at the Met On a cold winter day in 1921, artist Man Ray placed some of his glass equipment on top of an unexposed sheet of photographic paper he found among the prints in his developing tray. This \"mistake\" produced something the artist would later dub a \"rayograph,\" and was essentially a photo taken without a camera. The works' transformative nature led the Dada poet Tristan Tzara to describe rayographs as capturing the moments \"when objects dream,\" and you can see those pieces on display at The Met until February 2026. Drawing from the collections of The Met and more than 50 U.S. and international lenders, the presentation will include more than 60 rayographs and 100 paintings, objects, prints, drawings, films and photographs to highlight the central role of the rayograph in Man Ray’s  practice.\n"

As visitors walk through, they’ll encounter a planting palette made up of increasingly rare—and nearly disappearing—native species. Artist Lily Kwong (you may remember her fromher gorgeous orchid showa few years ago) collaborated with the Madison Square Park Conservancy to create the destination, which will be accessible through Labor Day.\n",

Mika Rottenberg’s “Foot Fountain (pink)” sits in all its weird glory at the 30th Street entrance, sputtering out water from its rather phallic top, through May 2026. “Foot Fountain (pink)” is a giant pink foot and lower leg that stands 10 feet tall and is peppered with tongues that stick out of lipsticked mouths. Its toenails are splashed with red nail polish, too. But the real kicker is the sculpture’s function: the working sprinkler on top can be activated by moving a set of pedals nearby, surprising or delighting passersby.\n"

Secluded and deluded, she haunts her own house and plots her grand return to the pictures; blinded by the spotlight in her mind, she is unaware that what she imagines to be a hungry audience out there in the dark is really just the dark.\n"

            "76.The Birch Trials exhibit at Fraunces Tavern As the Revolutionary War came to a close, British Loyalists and soldiers evacuated the colonies in droves. But the evacuation was more complicated for Black Loyalists, some of whom joined the British cause in response to offers of freedom. In 1783, the new government formed a special committee to review the eligibility of some Black Loyalists to evacuate with the British Army, and that committee met at Fraunces Tavern in Lower Manhattan. A new permanent exhibit at the Fraunces Tavern Museum explores this important moment in history. The exhibition first opened last year, and officials are now moving it to a larger permanent gallery within the museum. The new space will offer a chance to include recent new discoveries of significant information concerning the identities of individuals participating in theBirchTrialsand their inclusion in the Book of Negroes.\n"

            "78.\"The Subway Is...\" exhibit On October 27, 1904, New Yorkers dressed in their finest clothing and hosted dinner parties to celebrate the big news of the year. After four years of messy, sometimes controversial construction, a subway had opened in New York City. Officials didn't know if people would show up for its debut, but more than 100,000 people descended beneath the ground that evening to traverse the system's 9 miles and 28 stations. The next day, a Sunday, more than 1 million people showed up on the subway's first full open day. It may not seem like a big deal to us now, but the subway was revolutionary—and it still is. A fascinating new exhibit at the New York Transit Museum in Brooklyn digs into the history and the future of our underground rail system. Titled \"The SubwayIs...,\" the exhibition brings together artifacts, photos, multimedia installations, old advertisements, train models and more to tell the story of our city's subway system.\n"
