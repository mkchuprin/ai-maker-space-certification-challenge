`# NYC Event Recommender - Project Presentation
## AI Engineering Certification Challenge

---

# Slide 1 — Title & Hook

**Product Name:** NYC Family Event Finder

**Value Proposition:** AI-powered event recommendations that understand what "baby-friendly outdoor brunch" really means, powered by real-time knowledge of what's currently happening in NYC.

**Hook:**
- **Pain:** Parents spend 30+ minutes filtering through dozens of NYC event listings, only to arrive and find venues aren't actually stroller-accessible
- **Outcome:** Get personalized, contextually-aware event recommendations in seconds, with confidence that the AI understands your constraints (budget, indoor/outdoor, baby-friendly needs)

**Visual:** Split screen showing "Before" (frustrated parent scrolling endlessly) vs "After" (relaxed parent with 3 perfect suggestions)

---

# Slide 2 — Problem

**The Problem:**
Keyword search can't understand "baby-friendly free outdoor activities" - it just matches words, not meaning.

**What We're Solving:**
- ✅ Natural language event search (no dropdown menus)
- ✅ Semantic understanding of context like "baby-friendly"
- ✅ Smart filtering (price, indoor/outdoor, category)
- ✅ Real-time knowledge of what's currently happening in NYC
- ❌ Not building: ticket booking, user accounts, multi-city

**Current Baseline (Without AI):**
- 8-15 minutes to find relevant events
- 3-5 search attempts per query
- Low satisfaction

# Slide 3 — Success

**North Star Metric:**
Recommendation relevance score (RAGAS composite) > 0.85 with <3 second response time

**Key Success Metrics:**
1. **Quality:**
   - Faithfulness > 0.85 (responses grounded in source data)
   - Answer Relevancy > 0.80 (responses directly address user query)
   - Context Precision > 0.80 (retrieved events are highly relevant)
   - Context Recall > 0.75 (all relevant events are retrieved)

2. **Performance:**
   - End-to-end latency < 3 seconds
   - Metadata filtering improves scores by 5-10%

3. **User Experience:**
   - 80% of queries return 5+ relevant results
   - Zero hallucinated event details (all facts traced to sources)

**Guardrails:**
- No fabricated event details (strict citation requirements)
- Privacy: No PII collection or user tracking
- Cost: <$0.10 per query (OpenAI API usage)
- Bias: Balanced indoor/outdoor event representation

**Measurement Plan:**
- RAGAS evaluation framework on 25+ test queries
- LangSmith tracing for observability
- A/B comparison: Baseline semantic search vs. Metadata-filtered retrieval
- Synthetic test set covering edge cases (free events, baby-friendly, indoor/outdoor)

# Slide 5 — Solution Overview

**Before/After Flow:**

**BEFORE (Keyword Search):**
```
User: "baby friendly outdoor events"
→ Basic keyword matching
→ Returns ALL events with words "baby" OR "outdoor"
→ User manually filters 40+ results
→ Opens 10+ tabs to read descriptions
→ Discovers half aren't actually baby-friendly
```

**AFTER (Agentic RAG):**
```
User: "baby friendly outdoor events"
→ AI understands intent + extracts filters
→ Semantic search in vector DB (Qdrant) with current NYC events
→ Returns top 10 contextually relevant events happening now
→ Each result includes explanation + source link
→ User makes decision in <1 minute
```

**Where AI Intervenes & Why:**

1. **Natural Language Understanding (Layer 4 - Orchestrators/Agents):**
   - **Retrieval Agent** parses query → extracts filters (baby_friendly=True, location="outdoor", price="free")
   - Why: Users don't want to use dropdown menus; conversational queries are more intuitive

2. **Semantic Search (Layers 2-3 - Embeddings + Vector DB):**
   - Embeds query with OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`
   - Searches Qdrant with metadata filters
   - Why: "Baby-friendly" means different things (stroller access, changing tables, quiet spaces) - embeddings capture semantic similarity

3. **Response Generation (Layer 4 - Agents):**
   - **Response Agent** formats results with explanations
   - Cites sources (URLs) for every fact
   - Why: Transparency builds trust; users can verify recommendations

**LLM Stack Mapping (Layers 0-8):**

| Layer | Implementation | Why |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| **L0: Context** | Problem definition, persona research | Foundation for all decisions |
| **L1: Data Pipelines** | Scrapy → TimeOut NYC → CSV | Clean, structured event data |
| **L2: Embeddings** | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` | Semantic understanding of descriptions |
| **L3: Vector DB** | Qdrant with metadata filtering | Fast hybrid search (semantic + filters) |
| **L4: Orchestrators** | 2-agent system (Retrieval + Response) | Focused responsibilities, easier debugging |
| **L5: UX** | FastAPI + simple HTML frontend | Citations, confidence, filter visibility |
| **L6: Evaluation** | RAGAS (faithfulness, relevancy, precision, recall) | Quantify quality improvements |
| **L7: Lifecycle** | LangSmith tracing, cost tracking | Observability for production readiness |
| **L8: Governance** | No PII collection, source attribution | Ethical AI practices |

**Key Components:**

1. **Data Pipeline:**
   - Scrapy spiders fetch 80+ current events from TimeOut NYC
   - System knows what's happening in NYC right now (weekly updates)
   - OpenAI extracts `baby_friendly` boolean from descriptions
   - Events stored with metadata (price, indoor/outdoor, category)

2. **Vector Database (Qdrant):**
   - Stores embeddings + metadata for hybrid search
   - Metadata filters applied BEFORE semantic search (performance optimization)
   - Local deployment for development, cloud-ready architecture

3. **Agent System:**
   - **Retrieval Agent:** 
     - Parses natural language query
     - Extracts filters (baby_friendly, price, indoor/outdoor, category)
     - Runs filtered semantic search
     - Returns top-10 results
   - **Response Agent:**
     - Formats results with explanations
     - Adds source citations
     - Generates natural language summaries

4. **API Layer:**
   - FastAPI with Pydantic models (type safety)
   - Endpoints: `/search` (POST), `/health` (GET)
   - CORS enabled for frontend integration

5. **Monitoring & Governance:**
   - **LangSmith:** Traces every query → retrieval → response flow
   - **RAGAS:** Automated evaluation on test set (25+ queries)
   - **Cost Tracking:** OpenAI token usage logged per query
   - **Governance:** No user data stored, all facts cited, bias checks on indoor/outdoor distribution

**Rollback & Versioning Strategy:**
- Vector DB snapshots before each data refresh
- Agent prompt versions tracked in Git
- Feature flags for metadata filtering (can toggle A/B)
- Gradual rollout plan: Internal → Pilot → Public

# Slide 8 — Results & Trade-offs

**Early Signals (Evaluation Results):**

| Metric | Baseline (No Filters) | Advanced (Metadata Filters) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Faithfulness** | 0.89 | 0.92 | +3% ✅ |
| **Answer Relevancy** | 0.82 | 0.87 | +6% ✅ |
| **Context Precision** | 0.78 | 0.85 | +9% ✅✅ |
| **Context Recall** | 0.73 | 0.79 | +8% ✅ |
| **Avg Response Time** | 2.1s | 2.4s | +0.3s ⚠️ |
| **Cost per Query** | $0.08 | $0.09 | +12.5% ⚠️ |

**Key Insights:**
1. ✅ **Metadata filtering significantly improves relevance** - especially Context Precision (+9%)
2. ✅ **All metrics exceed success thresholds** (Faithfulness >0.85, Precision >0.80)
3. ⚠️ **Slight latency increase** acceptable (still under 3s target)
4. ⚠️ **Cost increase minimal** (still under $0.10 target)

**Pilot Data (Synthetic Test Set - 25 Queries):**
- 92% of queries returned 5+ relevant events
- Zero hallucinations detected (all facts traced to sources)
- Edge cases handled well:
  - Multi-filter queries ("free baby-friendly outdoor events")
  - Vague queries ("fun things to do")
  - Venue type requests ("indoor activities for families")

**Key Trade-offs & Rationale:**

| Trade-off | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Embeddings: OpenAI vs. Open-Source** | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` | Higher quality semantic understanding justifies $0.02/query cost; local models tested poorly on "baby-friendly" nuances |
| **Agents: 2 vs. 5+** | 2 agents (Retrieval + Response) | Simpler debugging, lower latency; complex multi-agent routing added 1-2s latency for marginal quality gain |
| **Metadata: LLM-extracted vs. Manual** | LLM extraction (baby_friendly only) | Scales to new events automatically; 95% accuracy on validation set; manual labeling not sustainable |
| **Search: Pure Semantic vs. Hybrid** | Hybrid (filters + semantic) | Filters ensure hard constraints met (price, indoor/outdoor); semantic handles vibe/mood; best of both worlds |
| **UI: Streamlit vs. HTML** | Simple HTML + FastAPI | Faster load times, full control over UX; Streamlit abstraction limited customization |
| **Vector DB: Qdrant vs. Pinecone** | Qdrant (local) | Free for development, production-ready, excellent metadata filtering; Pinecone pricier for pilot |

**Unexpected Findings:**
- **"Baby-friendly" is multi-dimensional:** Stroller access ≠ toddler engagement ≠ nursing-friendly. Semantic search captures nuances better than boolean flag alone.
- **Indoor/outdoor filtering is highly effective:** Separating venue types before semantic search significantly improves relevance, especially for weather-dependent planning.
- **Price is binary in practice:** Users either want "free" or don't care about cost; granular price filtering ($, $$, $$$) less useful than expected.

# Slide 9 — Conclusions

**Summary:**
Built an Agentic RAG system that understands natural language event queries, knows what's currently happening in NYC, retrieves contextually relevant events, and provides explainable recommendations in <3 seconds. Metadata filtering improved relevance by 5-10% while maintaining sub-3s latency and <$0.10/query cost.

**Risks & Mitigations:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Data Staleness** (events become outdated) | High | Medium | Automated weekly scraping + "Last updated" timestamp shown to users |
| **API Cost Overruns** (viral adoption) | Medium | High | Rate limiting (10 queries/min/user) + budget alerts at $100/day |
| **Bias in Recommendations** (favor indoor/outdoor) | Medium | Medium | Monitor indoor/outdoor distribution in results; ensure balanced representation |
| **Hallucinations** (fabricated event details) | Low | High | Strict citation requirements + user feedback loop to catch errors |
| **Privacy Concerns** (query logging) | Low | Medium | No PII collection + clear privacy policy; queries logged anonymously for improvement |
