That’s what makes these new abstract artworks by Jennie C. Jones so mind-bending. Three massive instrument sculptures now sit on the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s rooftop in Jones’ latest work titled “Ensemble.” But only one of the instruments makes sound when it’s activated by the wind. The other two don’t make sound at all, even though they’re capable of doing so. That's exactly the point.

Oscar Isaac is Baron Victor Frankenstein, who is rescued from a monster on the ice by the crew of a ship of polar explorers. He is a man with a tale to tell of how he got there: but, like Dewey Cox inWalk Hard, he has to start at the very beginning: with a childhood of a bad daddy (Charles Dance) and grief that drives an ambition to conquer death itself. Isaac is superb as Victor, as much an artist as a scientist; his gruesome work accompanied by Alexander Desplat's joyful waltz as he peels skin and gets elbow deep in viscera. Del Toro makes no secret of where his sympathy lies and who the real monsters are, but there are surprises here. Not least of which is how moved you might feel in the end.

Not only is he not a mastermind, Josh O’Connor’s unemployed Massachusetts carpenter James Blaine ‘JB’ Mooney would makeFargo’s Jerry Lundegaard look like the last word in criminal competence. Mooney plans to steal four abstract – and fairly low value – portraits by modernist painter Arthur Dove from his local gallery based loosely on a real-life 1973 heist of Massachusetts’s Worcester Art Museum, With the vinyl feel of ’70s cinema and powered by Rob Mazurek’s jazzy heist movie score,The Masterminda wonderfully evocative of a very specific moment in pre-Watergate America: a time of campus protests, fugitives from the draft, and political awakening. Nicely played with an on-form O’Connor, the frowning, sweater-clad Mooney is a counterpoint to all of that. He’s only a runaway from his own life.

That wait, though, turns out to be a very smart move. Four years have also passed inBlack Phone 2’s reality. That time has not healed Finn and his sister Gwen (again played by Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw). In the original, 13-year-old Finn was kidnapped by serial child-killer ‘The Grabber’ (Ethan Hawke) and kept in a basement, awaiting execution. Finn bested the killer with the help of past victims, who contacted him by phone from beyond the grave, and his sister’s peculiar premonitions.

Spanning more than 3,000 years, the Egyptian people's belief system grew to include more than 1,500 gods with many overlapping forms and traits. At the exhibit, expect to see statues and small elegant figurines that represent 25 of ancient Egypt's main deities. Look for subtle visual cues, like what a figure wore, how they posed or the symbols they carried to help identify each one. ""The ways in which the ancient Egyptian gods were depicted are vastly different from the divine beings in contemporary religions and therefore are intriguing to modern audiences,"" said Diana Craig Patch, Lila Acheson Wallace Curator in Charge of Egyptian Art in a press release about the exhibition. ""The identity of an ancient Egyptian god may at first seem easy to recognize but looks can be deceiving, as one form can be shared by many deities. Across more than 3,000 years of history, gods, attributes, roles and myths were rarely dropped from use, yet the Egyptians of the time had no difficulty understanding and accepting the resulting multiplicity.
